	abstract = {Generally, phenomena of spontaneous pattern formation are random and repetitive, whereas elaborate devices are the deterministic product of human design. Yet, biological organisms and collective insect constructions are exceptional examples of complex systems (CS) that are both architectured and self-organized. Can we understand their precise self-formation capabilities and integrate them with technological planning? Can physical systems be endowed with information, or informational systems be embedded in physics, to create autonomous morphologies and functions? To answer these questions, we have launched in 2009, and developed through a series of workshops and a collective book, a new field of research called morphogenetic engineering. It is the first initiative of its kind to rally and promote models and implementations of complex self-architecturing systems. Particular emphasis is set on the programmability and computational abilities of self-organization, properties that are often underappreciated in CS science—while, conversely, the benefits of self-organization are often underappreciated in engineering methodologies.

Therefore, research on urban spirals, both past and projected, is necessary for efficient urban land use planning and management. This study aims to assess the spatio-temporal urban sprawl dynamics from 2003 to 2033 in Mbombela, South Africa. We employed robust approaches such as machine learning, the cellular automata-Markov chain, and the Shannon entropy model to look at how urban sprawl changes over time using both the Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper and the 8 Operational Land Imagers. We conducted this study to bridge the gaps in existing research, which primarily focuses on past and current urban growth trends rather than future trends. The findings indicated that the coverage of built-up areas and vegetation has expanded by 1.98 km2 and 13.23 km2 between the years 2003 and 2023. On the other hand, the amount of land continues to decrease by -12.56 km2 and − 2.65 km2 annually, respectively. We anticipate an increase in the built-up area and vegetation to a total of 7.60 km2 and 0.57 km2, respectively, by the year 2033. We anticipate a total annual decline of -7.78 km2 and − 0.39 km2 in water bodies and open land coverage, respectively.

	abstract = {The population settlements in the fast-growing urban world need to be monitored in order to design a sustainable urban habitat. The remote sensing and GIS are considered as an effective monitoring and decision-support tool in urban planning. This study compiles the results of a study undertaken to measure the urban sprawl in Dehradun city, India through cellular automata CA-Markov model. CA-Markov model can effectively be used to study the urban dynamics in rapidly growing cities. Being an effective tool for encoding spatial structures, the information generated by it could be used to predict urban scenarios for sustainable growth. To achieve the goal, the temporal images of LISS IV were used to analyse the spatial pattern of land cover change in the area and the future growth was modeled by applying CA-Markov model. The results clearly suggest that major changes between the periods of 2004 and 2009 occurred in built up classes (about 27\%) followed by agriculture (17.7\%) and fallow land (10.2\%). The projection as predicted using CA-Markov model suggested a value of kappa coefficient=0.91 which indicates the validity of the model to predict future projections. Modeling suggested a clear trend of various land use classes’ transformation in the area of urban built up expansions. It is concluded that RS and GIS can be an effective decision support tool for policy makers to design sustainable urban habitats.},

	abstract = {We need a conceptually different idea of cities which paradigmatically shifts their forms and structures toward more liveable future environments, both for us and our planet. The Isobenefit Urbanism is conceived within a medium-long term perspective mixing a macro top-down planning with a micro bottom-up spontaneous evolution in an attempt to moderate the human forces which typically induce agglomeration benefits and costs, maintaining the former while limiting the latter. It indicates a simple efficient urban genetic code to generate cities that are walkable, carless, low carbon, adaptive, connected, compact, multifunctional settlements throughout nature, with unplanned forms and unlimitedly extendible, in which one can feel both urbanity and nature. They are flexible cities and dynamically changeable. By holding constant the number of inhabitants of a usual city or megacity, its counterpart Isobenefit city would enjoy the same economies of scale benefits but without their costs. The Isobenefit Urbanism model might offer a potential solution to current issues of wild cementification, urban heat island effects, destruction of natural land and biodiversity, carbon emissions, congestions and related air pollution, as well as provide an urban model to host the enormous new urban inhabitants our world must accommodate in the next few decades. Its ultimate ambition is to enjoy the economies of agglomeration without incurring to the diseconomies of agglomeration, manifested by sublinear and superlinear outputs, typically infrastructural the former and socioeconomic the latter.},

	abstract = {Sustainable Development Goals are intrinsically competing, and their embedding into urban systems furthermore emphasises such compromises. When observed at the scale of systems of cities, such concern is considered as a series of innovations that challenges the adaptive capacity of urban systems. The spatial complexity, the non-optimal nature of such systems, and the multi-objective aspects of their agents, are among the reasons that raise difficulties when trying to adjust local policies through promoting innovation in order to satisfy at least a couple of SDGs simultaneously. As we lack enough empirical evidence, we propose in this paper to use a stylised simulation model for systems of cities, focused on innovation diffusion and population dynamics, to show how trade-offs may operate at such a scale. We proceed in particular to a bi-objective optimisation of emissions and innovation utilities, and show that no single urban optimum exists, but a diversity of regimes forming a compromise between the two objectives.},

In this paper, we review progress to date in this field. We show how these new approaches are consistent with traditional urban models that have gone before with the emphasis no longer being on spatial interaction but on the dynamics of development and local movement. We first introduce a generic structure for urban simulation based on ideas about spatial evolution as reaction and diffusion, and then show how problems conceived in terms of cells, or agents, or both enable new implementations of this generic model. We sketch the rudiments of cellular automata (CA) which emphasises rules of development, and agent-based models which focus on how agents respond to attributes of their environment often encoded in cellular landscapes. We develop various exemplars based on residential location to impress the way these approaches work. Three applications are then presented at very different spatial scales: first pedestrian movement at the building scale, then the evolution of systems of cities at a country scale, and finally urban growth at the city scale. In developing these approaches, we show how cellular and agent-based models have the potential for explicitly incorporating spatial interaction and transportation which is their current weakness. We conclude with proposals that formal policy analysis in this domain should always be informed by more than one approach.},

	abstract = {Transformative adaptation (TA) places emphasis on changing the underlying causes of climate risk. Little is known about how TA can be achieved in practice in southern African cities. This paper reports on a set of criteria, derived from the literature and transdisciplinary engagements, for taking TA from theory into practice. These are: fundamental/sustainable changes in thinking and doing; inclusivity; challenging power asymmetries; demonstrability; responsive and flexible; and holistic, complex systems thinking. These criteria were explored through five water-related projects in Durban (South Africa) and Harare (Zimbabwe), which were identified by actors as having transformative potential to reduce urban climate risks. The study suggests that trade-offs might need to be made between several of these criteria, with strong synergies between others. Challenging power asymmetries is important in southern African cities where adaptation should change the structures of society that give rise to highly differential climate vulnerabilities. Challenging power structures largely requires true inclusivity and an equal stake in shaping decisions as opposed to tokenistic participation. While TA is needed in southern African cities, the complexity of these contexts and the scale of TA ambition introduces practical challenges when compared with incremental adaptation, i.e. small changes to existing practices to reduce climate impacts within the current development paradigm. Given such practical limitations, the paper concludes that TA in southern African cities might pragmatically be attempted as part of a process of ongoing learning to identify opportunities for gradual restructuring and expanding, in scale and ambition towards transformation.},

While the rate is slowing down in the Global North, the opposite is happening in parts of the Global South. This paper assesses the trajectory of urbanisation in Southern Africa over the last 40 years. This is one of the fastest urbanising regions of the world. It analyses four themes: cities’ growth rates, size distribution, built-up areas and urban density. Several findings suggest that urbanisation has become slightly more manageable since the turn of the century. There has been a gradual decline in the urban population growth rate, the number of cities is increasing more slowly than before, and the urban footprint is expanding more slowly. South Africa and Zimbabwe exemplify these trends. Other findings give greater cause for concern and warrant more government attention. Growth is unevenly distributed across the size spectrum, with the largest cities growing much faster than smaller cities. In addition, the highest urban densities are in the poorest countries, suggesting that density takes the form of overcrowded informal settlements rather than liveable and productive places. The DRC and Mozambique exemplify these challenges.},

However, varying morphological aspects may have divergent effects on Outdoor Thermal Comfort (OTC) in cities. Unlike UHI, which is derived from urban-rural temperature differences, OTC can be quantified by thermal comfort indices considering the objective assessment of microclimatic variables including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), mean radiant temperature (TMRT), and wind speed (Va), as well as a subjective assessment of individual perception. In Singapore and other tropical cities, thermally uncomfortable conditions prevail year-round due to higher Ta and RH coupled with high solar irradiance from its equatorial location. To better understand the relationship between density related morphological variables, microclimate conditions and OTC in Singapore, we first conduct a systematic literature review to identify existing research gaps and uncertainties. We subsequently analyse prominent building bylaws and urban planning codes of Singapore to understand the potential comfort implications of existing urban morphological norms. Finally, we propose a methodological framework on how to address the gaps and uncertainties in mainstream urban design and urban planning process keeping into consideration microclimatic, comfort and socio-economic variables.},

Therefore, research on urban spirals, both past and projected, is necessary for efficient urban land use planning and management. This study aims to assess the spatio-temporal urban sprawl dynamics from 2003 to 2033 in Mbombela, South Africa. We employed robust approaches such as machine learning, the cellular automata-Markov chain, and the Shannon entropy model to look at how urban sprawl changes over time using both the Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper and the 8 Operational Land Imagers. We conducted this study to bridge the gaps in existing research, which primarily focuses on past and current urban growth trends rather than future trends. The findings indicated that the coverage of built-up areas and vegetation has expanded by 1.98 km2 and 13.23 km2 between the years 2003 and 2023. On the other hand, the amount of land continues to decrease by -12.56 km2 and − 2.65 km2 annually, respectively. We anticipate an increase in the built-up area and vegetation to a total of 7.60 km2 and 0.57 km2, respectively, by the year 2033. We anticipate a total annual decline of -7.78 km2 and − 0.39 km2 in water bodies and open land coverage, respectively.

	abstract = {For the next decade, the global water crisis remains the risk of highest concern, and ranks ahead of climate change, extreme weather events, food crises and social instability. Across the globe, nearly one in ten people is without access to an improved drinking water source. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are the most affected, having disproportionately more of the global population without access to clean water than other major regions. Population growth, changing lifestyles, increasing pollution and accelerating urbanization will continue to widen the gap between the demand for water and available supply especially in urban areas, and disproportionately affect informal settlements, where the majority of SSA's urban population resides. Distribution and allocation of water will be affected by climate-induced water stresses, poor institutions, ineffective governance, and weak political will to address scarcity and mediate uncertainties in future supply. While attempts have been made by many scientists to examine different dimensions of water scarcity and urban population dynamics, there are few comprehensive reviews, especially focused on the particular situation in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper contributes to interdisciplinary understanding of urban water supply by distilling and integrating relevant empirical knowledge on urban dynamics and water issues in SSA, focusing on progress made and associated challenges. It then points out future research directions including the need to understand how alternatives to centralized water policies may help deliver sustainable water supply to cities and informal settlements in the region.},

The remote sensing and GIS are considered as an effective monitoring and decision-support tool in urban planning. This study compiles the results of a study undertaken to measure the urban sprawl in Dehradun city, India through cellular automata CA-Markov model. CA-Markov model can effectively be used to study the urban dynamics in rapidly growing cities. Being an effective tool for encoding spatial structures, the information generated by it could be used to predict urban scenarios for sustainable growth. To achieve the goal, the temporal images of LISS IV were used to analyse the spatial pattern of land cover change in the area and the future growth was modeled by applying CA-Markov model. The results clearly suggest that major changes between the periods of 2004 and 2009 occurred in built up classes (about 27\%) followed by agriculture (17.7\%) and fallow land (10.2\%). The projection as predicted using CA-Markov model suggested a value of kappa coefficient=0.91 which indicates the validity of the model to predict future projections. Modeling suggested a clear trend of various land use classes’ transformation in the area of urban built up expansions. It is concluded that RS and GIS can be an effective decision support tool for policy makers to design sustainable urban habitats.},

However, mathematical models can often be loosely related to data or have so many parameters that model behaviour is weakly constrained. Recent methods in machine learning introduce new means by which models can be derived and deployed.

Over the past century, numerous processes have been identified as critically contributing to morphogenetic events, but the interplay between the various components and aspects of pattern formation have been much harder to grasp. The combination of traditional biology with mathematical and computational methods has had a profound effect on our current understanding of morphogenesis and led to significant insights and advancements in the field. In particular, the theoretical concepts of reaction–diffusion systems and positional information, proposed by Alan Turing and Lewis Wolpert, respectively, dramatically influenced our general view of morphogenesis, although typically in isolation from one another. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been emerging as a consolidation and implementation of the two theories within a single framework. Agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to integrate combinations of heterogeneous processes and investigate their respective dynamics, especially in the context of spatial phenomena. In this review, we highlight the benefits and technical challenges associated with ABMs as tools for examining morphogenetic events. These models display unparalleled flexibility for studying various morphogenetic phenomena at multiple levels and have the important advantage of informing future experimental work, including the targeted engineering of tissues and organs.},

	abstract = {By 2050, half of the net increase in the world’s population is expected to reside in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), driving high urbanization rates and drastic land cover changes. However, the data-scarce environment of SSA limits our understanding of the urban dynamics in the region. In this context, Earth Observation (EO) is an opportunity to gather accurate and up-to-date spatial information on urban extents. During the last decade, the adoption of open-access policies by major EO programs (CBERS, Landsat, Sentinel) has allowed the production of several global high resolution (10–30 m) maps of human settlements. However, mapping accuracies in SSA are usually lower, limited by the lack of reference datasets to support the training and the validation of the classification models. Here we propose a mapping approach based on multi-sensor satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-1, Envisat, ERS) and volunteered geographic information (OpenStreetMap) to solve the challenges of urban remote sensing in SSA. The proposed mapping approach is assessed in 17 case studies for an average F1-score of 0.93, and applied in 45 urban areas of SSA to produce a dataset of urban expansion from 1995 to 2015. Across the case studies, built-up areas averaged a compound annual growth rate of 5.5\% between 1995 and 2015. The comparison with local population dynamics reveals the heterogeneity of urban dynamics in SSA. Overall, population densities in built-up areas are decreasing. However, the impact of population growth on urban expansion differs depending on the size of the urban area and its income class.},
